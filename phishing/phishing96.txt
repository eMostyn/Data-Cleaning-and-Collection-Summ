Microsoft has described the problem as "critical," the highest level of alert. 

The flaw is not related to the Mydoom bug, which is behind one of the biggest virus epidemics to hit the internet.

People using Internet Explorer versions 5.01, 5.50 and 6 are being urged to download a security patch from Microsoft's website.



The security update addresses three flaws in Microsoft's browser. The most serious is one which could direct a user to a fake website, even though the internet link looked real.

The flaw could be used in so-called "phishing" scams in which people are sent e-mails and asked to click on a link to update financial information or verify passwords. 

"This vulnerability has already been in use since December, and we've been in great anticipation for an update," said Jimmy Kuo of anti-virus firm McAfee.

"A user could see the address www.citibank.com, but could actually be somewhere else." 

Phishing has been used by fraudsters and organised crime to get customer bank details.

Some leading financial institutions have had their names used in "spoof" e-mails. 

In December, NatWest temporarily suspended its internet banking facility after some of its customers were sent fraudulent e-mails asking them to divulge their account details. 

In October, Nationwide and NatWest were targeted by a similar hoax as was the Halifax, while in September fraudsters tried to trick customers of Lloyds TSB and Barclays.
