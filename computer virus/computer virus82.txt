        The BBC has been unable to confirm or disprove the allegations.Flame is thought to have been first noticed when Iran's servers were taken offline in April following a malware attack on key oil terminals.A later report by anti-virus company Kaspersky Labs said there had been 189 attacks in Iran, 98 in Israel and Palestine, and 32 in Sudan. A "former high-ranking US intelligence official", who it said had spoken on the condition of anonymity, told the Washington Post: "[Flame] is about preparing the battlefield for another type of covert action."Cyber-collection against the Iranian programme is way further down the road than this."Iran has said it is now able to defend itself against the malware and clean up infected PCs .But the attacks could lead the country to develop its own sophisticated cyber-capabilities, Mark Phillips, a research fellow at defence think tank the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told BBC News."If it did originate from the US and/or Israel, Iran is going to feel under siege as a result of a number of attempts - a previous one was Stuxnet - and will seek to improve its cyber-defences," he said."The better you are at detecting cyber-actions, the better you are at infiltrating others.
