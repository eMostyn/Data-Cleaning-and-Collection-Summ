The Federal Bureau of Invesigation in the United States has warned that a new and dangerous computer virus is spreading through e-mail systems which use Microsoft software.
A number of corporate systems are reported to have been effected, some of which have been shut down.
The FBI says that many more systems could become infected over the coming days.
The virus is carried in an e-mail entitled Resume - Janet Simons and, once opened, spreads to everyone in a user's e-mail address book.
Earlier this month, millions of computers around the world were closed down by the Love Bug virus which originated in the Philippines and is thought to have caused up to ten billion dollars worth of damage.
