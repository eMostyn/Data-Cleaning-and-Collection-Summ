The US Coast Guard (USCG) issued a security bulletin on 16 December, urging other bases to take measures to prevent further attacks. "Once the embedded malicious link in the email was clicked by an employee, the ransomware allowed for a threat actor to access significant enterprise information technology (IT) network files, and encrypt them, preventing the facility's access to critical files," it said.
