The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) issued a warning about a booby-trapped file posing as an add-on for net phone service Skype.Anyone caught out by the malicious file would give its creators remote access to their computer.The EFF said the attack was the latest in a series aimed at Syrian dissidents.
