malicious bot25.txt
The mystery of the robot congresswoman has been solved. Representative Eliza Turing, a Twitter bot whose , was created by Adam Kraft, a 41-year-old computer programmer and amateur botsmith. Ms. Turing’s material comes from about 10 Twitter accounts Mr. Kraft has identified as pro-Clinton. Some belong to ordinary people, Mr. Kraft said in an interview, and others to publications like Mother Jones. The bot’s programming splits the tweets into parts and puts the parts together randomly, resulting in tweets like this: GOP senator says college students don’t need teachers, can undergo complete psychological evaluation. —    Trump supporters & Breitbart, stop with profanity-laced voicemail. —  Mr. Kraft had previously created the Bernie Sanders Bot, which used the senator’s tweets as source material, but he wanted to experiment with an account that didn’t explicitly identify itself as a bot. Thus Ms. Turing and her husband, , were born. Mr. Turing, who identifies himself as a conservative and a Christian, remixes the tweets of Donald Trump supporters. I’m not the first to be fooled by one of the bots — other users have gotten into arguments with them, and after the Democratic National Committee email hack, some feared that Ms. Turing was part of some sort of conspiracy. “They think it’s maybe malicious, like somebody’s trying to influence the election,” Mr. Kraft said. Mr. Kraft created the bots “mainly for entertainment value,” he explained. But they were also something of an experiment in political rhetoric. “There’s a lot of people on both sides, left and right, saying some crazy stuff,” he said, “and I just want to see if the bot can say stuff that’s even crazier.” Eliza Turing’s tweets really aren’t much stranger than Donald Trump’s speeches. But unlike Mr. Trump, at least she’s funny.
