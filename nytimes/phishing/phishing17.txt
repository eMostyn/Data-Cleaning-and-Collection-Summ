If for nothing else, Phish deserves credit for becoming one of the most popular and successful rock groups without the help of radio or MTV. The band, which formed in Vermont in 1983, released its major-label debut, ''A Picture of Nectar,'' in 1992. Now with its eighth studio album, ''Farmhouse,'' and with the demise of the Grateful Dead, Phish has become the uncontested leader of the jam-band brigade. Fronted by Trey Anastasio, the band has an unbreakable bond with its devoted audience, which has further garnered them comparisons to the Dead. Anastasio is an exceptionally expressive guitarist and creatively loopy songwriter. Through his experimentation, Phish's tie-dyed hippie fans have been joined by a more sophisticated group of jazz lovers. Jamming is the key here, so expect long, transcendental psychedelic riffs (with jazz, Middle-Eastern, folk, Zappa-esque, and blues influences), melancholy acoustic songs, and even a pop ditty or two. Most of their historically long sets are infectious, transporting musical mantras. Phish performs on at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday at PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel and at 7:30 p.m. on July 3 and 4 ROBBIE WOLIVER
