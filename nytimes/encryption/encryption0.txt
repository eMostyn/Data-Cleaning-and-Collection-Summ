After a long battle with the computer industry, the Clinton administration has finally dropped its export ban on strong encryption technology, and Netscape Communications Corp. has just begun offering a browser with 128-bit encryption for users outside the United States. This major change in U.S. policy means that Web sites that had been closed to non-U.S. residents, such as many of those operated by financial institutions, are now available. It also means that users outside the United States can conduct electronic commerce with essentially unbreakable codes. Until now, the United States regarded strong encryption as a secret vital to national security and law enforcement. The change reflects the reality that in the electronic world, there are no borders, and enforcement of export controls on software is next to impossible. Microsoft Corp. has said that its Windows 2000 software, due to be shipped in February, will have 128-bit encryption for all users. Previously, 56-bit encryption was the strongest that could legally be exported from the United States. A malefactor bent on breaking a 56-bit code would have one chance in billions of guessing the correct key. But 128-bit encryption makes the problem 4.7 billion trillion times harder, Netscape says. The FBI has repeatedly asked Congress to enact restrictions on the use of cryptography so that it can keep track of communications by criminals and terrorists. But so far, privacy advocates and civil libertarians have persuaded Congress that that is not a good idea. The Netscape browser is free and can be downloaded at home.netscape.com/download. If you already use Netscape and want to upgrade to the version with 128-bit encryption, go to home.netscape.com/smartupdate. Another browser, called Opera, which has a small but very loyal following, has long offered 128-bit encryption outside the United States. Opera 3.61 costs $35, and a trial version, good for 30 days, can be downloaded from www.opera.com/download.html.
