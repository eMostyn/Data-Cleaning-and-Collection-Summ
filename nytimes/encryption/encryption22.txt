February 18, 2016 Apple is with a federal court order to help the F.B.I. unlock an iPhone 5c used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who was killed by the police along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, after they orchestrated a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., in December that left 14 people dead. The move sets up a legal showdown between Apple — it does not possess the technology to open the phone and will not create it because it would threaten the privacy of its customers — and the law enforcement authorities, who say that new encryption technologies hamper their ability to prevent and solve crime. Should companies have to unlock encrypted communication in the case of a crime? Cyrus Vance Jr., Manhattan district attorney Decisions about who can access key evidence in criminal investigations should be made by courts and legislatures, not by Apple and Google. Sophia Cope, Electronic Frontier Foundation This kind of technological power will become ripe for abuse not only by the government, but also by identity thieves, estranged spouses or anyone who would benefit from snooping into your life. James Lewis, Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington All the U.S. and other countries are asking for is lawful access to communications when authorized by a court — not a backdoor into phones. Nuala O'Connor, Center for Democracy and Technology When law enforcement and intelligence agencies try to mandate defects in the devices that power our daily lives, they are inherently making us all less secure. Joel Reidenberg, law professor The government should have an ability to compel companies to unlock encrypted devices for access to evidence of crimes, but it should not be able to force companies to build access tools and security vulnerabilities.
