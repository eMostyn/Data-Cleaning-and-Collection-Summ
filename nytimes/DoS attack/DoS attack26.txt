New Hacker Attack Software Targets PC's February 25, 2000 New Hacker Attack Software Targets PC's By REUTERS EW YORK, Feb 24 -- A new version of the software that crippled online retailers such as Amazon.com and eBay Inc earlier this month allows hackers to launch attacks from Windows-based personal computers of the kind found in many homes, a U.S. computer security company said. A report late Tuesday from San Jose, California-based Finjan Software said the new Trinoo "zombie" tool gives hackers the ability to launch a coordinated distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on a company from Windows-based PCs and servers, rather than from high-performance Unix servers. DDos attacks can temporarily shut down a computer system by bomdarding it with an overwhelming number of requests. Finjan's report said the newly released Trinoo program can be delivered by electronic mail, like other so-called "Trojans" and remote access tools. It allows a hacker to place "zombie" agents on Windows PCs and servers around the world and then wake them up to launch a crippling stream of Internet traffic at a target company's Web site. This makes it potentially more dangerous than earlier Trojans, because of the vast number of Windows-based PCs in place around the world compared to the limited number of Unix systems, Finjan said. "To see tools such as Trinoo available for Windows PCs means that denial of service attacks now are that much easier to launch," Bill Lyons, president and chief executive of Finjan Software, said in a statement. "It's taking the sophistication level down a notch because the 'script kiddies' who may not be Unix experts can launch DoS attacks from PCs."
