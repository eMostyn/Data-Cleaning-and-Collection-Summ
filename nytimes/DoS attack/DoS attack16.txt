CHESS When a grandmaster is taken by surprise in an opening variation he has not kept up with because he did not expect his opponent to use it, he usually takes what he hopes will be a neutral course, an old variation that has not attracted attention for a while. He does not expect to put pressure on the opponent, he just hopes to avoid the latest tactical tricks. He wants to get to a quiet middle game and see what turns up. A reasonable idea, except that some outmoded lines no longer appear because they are inferior, not really safe. That was the case in a second-round game at the Goodricke International Open Tournament in Calcutta in early February. The Czech grandmaster Pavel Blatny chose a line of play that was abandoned 40 years ago, and his opponent, the grandmaster Gregory Kaidanov of Lexington, Ky., was happy to show him what was wrong with it. Kaidanov went on to win the Swiss System event with an 8 1/2-2 1/2 score. The Armenian grandmaster Vladimir Akopian and the German international master Mathias Roeder tied for second with 8-3. The Open Defense to the Ruy Lopez with 5 . . . Ne4 has recently been leading to variations of great complexity. An example is 6 d4 b5 7 Bb3 d5 8 de Be6 9 Nbd2 Nc5 10 c3 d4 11 Ng5 Bd5 12 Nf7! Kf7 13 Qf3 Ke6 14 Qg4 Ke7 15 e6!? Be6 16 Re1 Qd7 17 Be6 Ne6 14 Qg4 Ke7 15 e6!? Be6 16 Re1 Qd7 17 Be6 Ne6 18 Nf3 Re8 19 Ng5 Ncd8 20 Bd2! in Peter Svidler-Viswanathan Anand, Dos Hermanas, 1999. Probably Blatny has not analyzed anything good against it, and so chooses an old procedure, 6 Bc6, one that has not proven its value, however. In place of 9 de, Blatny could have recaptured with 9 Ne5, but after 9 . . . Be7 10 Be3 O-O 11 c4 f6 12 Nf3 f5 13 Bd2 f4 14 Bc3 Ng5, Black gets superior play with his two bishops. After 10 . . . Nc5, a position has arisen in which Black has the bishop pair and a compact pawn position. White has a four-to-three-pawn majority on the kingside, while Black's four queenside pawns can be blocked by White's three. These factors don't balance each other; Black has the best winning chances, because he has an easier time finding objects of attack. After 14 . . . Re8!, the minimum amount of damage Blatny could have suffered would have been 15 f4 f6 16 f5 fe 17 fg ed 18 Bd4 hg, when the two sets of doubled pawns constitute a small hindrance to Kaidanov's winning the game. After 15 . . . Nd7, defense by 16 Re1 fails against 16 . . . c5 17 Nf3 Bc2, so Blatny must lose a pawn. After 22 . . . Re7!, Blatny could not get his pawn back with 23 Rd4 because of 23 . . . Rf7 24 Ke2 Bc5 25 Rc4 Rf2 26 Ke1 (26 Kd3 Rd8 27 Ke4 Re8 ends in 28 Kd5 Rf5mate) Re8 27 Re4 Re4 28 Ne4 Rg2, when 29 Nc5? is killed by 29 . . . Rg1. After 51 . . . h5, Blatny gave up his lost rook-and-pawn ending.
