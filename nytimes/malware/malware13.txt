THERE is a kind of software that has consistently gotten faster and more powerful, and is available free worldwide. Unfortunately, it is ''malicious software,'' the insidious purveyor of viruses and other threats. According to the security company Symantec, the overall rate of attack activity from this broad category of high-tech threats -- known commonly as malware -- rose nearly 20 percent in the last year. Attacks are spreading more quickly, as well. Viruses used to take months to propagate, and then days. But a worm called Slammer that struck in January ''infected 90 percent of the vulnerable systems in just 15 minutes,'' a Symantec executive, Arthur Wong, said in recent Congressional testimony. Sounding a common note among cybersecurity professionals, Mr. Wong said that ''the time from the discovery of a new vulnerability to the release of an exploit targeting that vulnerability is rapidly shrinking.'' The Slammer worm appeared six months after the discovery of the vulnerability that it exploited; the Blaster worm came six months later and less than a month after the vulnerability that it exploited was disclosed. Because many of the intrusive programs scan the Internet for vulnerable machines automatically, no computer will avoid the probes when it is online, said Vincent Weafer, senior director of the Symantec AntiVirus Research Center. ''If you're on the Internet, even if you're only on a dial-up, you will be attacked,'' he said. As if that were not intimidating enough, viruses and worms are becoming more dangerous. Until recently, the point of most malware was simply to spread. But more and more, the newer programs open back doors into targeted machines and pave the way for computer intrusion that can lead to the loss of personal information, or even enlistment of the computer to attack other computers as a ''zombie'' or to send spam. ''They are finding ways to use viruses and worms for profit,'' said Tracy Hulver, director for product management for McAfee Security. Consumers hoping to protect their home computers against malware will find that the challenges are getting tougher, and the defensive arsenal can be bewildering. Attempts to educate consumers are growing, with the founding this year of the National Cyber Security Alliance, a partnership of the federal government and high-technology companies. The group has an education Web site (www.staysafeonline.info) and, working with the Department of Homeland Security and the Ad Council, it recently announced a $1.8 million national cybersecurity awareness campaign. Computer security experts say that consumers should have, at minimum, antivirus software that is updated regularly and a firewall, which can keep unauthorized data from entering or leaving the machine. Security companies are trying to meet consumers' need to address the various threats by blending their protections. Major antivirus companies, including Symantec, McAfee and Trend Micro, all offer packages of Internet security programs that include antivirus and firewall protection, along with some combination of protection against user-monitoring ''spyware,'' pop-up ads and unsolicited e-mail messages, or spam. Those companies offer free trial versions of software, and Computer Associates International, which makes security software for businesses, announced last month that it would make its antivirus and firewall software available to consumers free for one year through Microsoft's security site, www.microsoft.com/security/protect. ''Increasingly, these security tools are coming together,'' said Mr. Weafer of Symantec, maker of the Norton Antivirus software. In addition, Internet service providers will, increasingly, be stepping up to protect their customers. Time Warner's America Online, EarthLink, the Microsoft Network and other service providers are trying to provide customers with bundles of software -- often as a premium version of the service -- that will help them protect themselves. ''We bring all that together for you, aggregate it, make it easy, and make it so you don't have to worry about it anymore,'' said Jim Anderson, vice president for product development at EarthLink. At the same time, the Microsoft Corporation, whose software is the target of the greatest number of successful attacks, says it is working to harden its products against attack. Because Microsoft's Windows operating system dominates the personal computer market, it is an attractive target for virus writers who hope to have the greatest effect. An analyst with Gartner, John Pescatore, said that when ''big gorillas'' like Microsoft enter the consumer security market, traditional security providers like Symantec and Network Associates, the parent company of McAfee, are ''likely to get trampled.'' Between actions by the big companies and newer technologies, the eventual result could be ''the possible death'' of the antivirus industry as it exists today, he said. The antivirus companies say such a dire outcome is not likely. ''We have a long history of partnership'' with Microsoft, said Mr. Hulver of McAfee, ''and we don't envision that partnership going away.'' The only certainty in this uncertain market is that there will be plenty to do. Software will continue to be vulnerable, and hackers and virus writers will continue to work around the clock. And, most important, high-speed Internet use will continue to spread, in turn spreading high-speed vulnerability to attacks and spam unless users shore up their machines with additional software defenses. ''What consumers are going to be hearing more and more,'' a spokesman for AOL, Andrew Weinstein, said, ''is if you only have a high-speed pipe, you have a high-speed sewage pipe.''
