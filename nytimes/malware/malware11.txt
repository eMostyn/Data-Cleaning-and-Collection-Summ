TECHNOLOGY The CERT Coordination Center is one of the premier places that the online world turns to for information when computer vandals attack; the federally financed research center, operated by Carnegie Mellon University, has long served as a clearinghouse for news on new viruses, worms and other virtual nastiness. But yesterday and Tuesday it was CERT that was being bombarded, and the center did not hold. Its Web site was knocked out by a distributed denial of service attack, in which malicious hackers take over computers on the Internet and cause them to flood a target site with spurious demands for data and other small tasks. A denial of service does not involve a break-in at the target site; it just keeps the victim's machine so busy responding to the stream of automated requests that legitimate visitors cannot get in. CERT, which stands for Computer Emergency Response Team, thus became one of thousands of sites each week to be subjected to this particular form of attack. (The Web site for the White House also came under attack on Tuesday and was blocked for about six hours, Jimmy Orr, a White House spokesman, said.) At Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, data flowed into the CERT network at rates ''a couple of hundred times higher than any peak we've ever seen before,'' said Rich Pethia, director of the part of the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon that runs CERT. Although computer viruses, worms and other so-called malware can be countered with good security practices and up-to-date defensive software, distributed denial of service attacks are hard to protect against, Mr. Pethia said: ''There is no good way to defend against it or stop it once it's started. The Internet wasn't built with any built-in flow control, so there's no way to throttle back'' on such attacks. He said that no one had determined where the attacks had come from and that the case was being investigated. The commandeered computers, which security experts call zombies, are often programmed to fabricate the Internet's version of a return address so that the sources of the attack are obscured. About 4,000 sites experience denial of service attacks each week, according to a new paper from researchers at the University of California at San Diego. Most of those attacks are brief and have little effect on the target, said David Moore, a senior researcher in the university's Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis. He said that he was not surprised to hear of the attack on Carnegie Mellon. ''Hackers,'' he said, ''want to say 'I took down this site that has security experts.' ''
