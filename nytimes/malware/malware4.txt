Why is Android such a big target for malware, and how can I tell if an app may be suspect before I install it? Android has become the dominant mobile operating system around the world, and like Windows before it, malware writers typically target the most commonly used platform in hopes of snaring the most victims. Not all phones can run the latest, more secure versions of the Android system, which can make them more vulnerable to malicious apps. Third-party app sites help spread malicious software as well. Common sense and a discerning eye can help keep your device safe. If you want to avoid malicious apps, get new software from trusted sources like the Google Play store or Amazon’s Android app store — and avoid installing any apps from random third-party sites. Although it does not make developers go through a formal approval process when submitting new apps, Google does that are added to its Google Play store for malware. The company has also that have wormed their way into the store. Sticking with apps from well-known developers or apps that have been professionally reviewed can help keep you away from the junk and scam programs that may have made it into the store. (Badly written or spammy apps are a universal problem and Apple’s App Store has plenty of those, too.) Even when shopping in the Google Play store, you should thoroughly check out an app before installing it. Be wary of apps that seem to have a lot of downloads and high ratings — but a minimal amount of written reviews — since a scammer may be trying to get attention. You can also check the app’s Permissions tab on the Google Play page to see what parts of your Android phone or tablet it wants to use, and then avoid apps that look too invasive. If you like to visit third-party app sites, you may want to consider installing from a reliable company. Some apps, like or , also help track lost phones and remotely wipe data — because a missing or stolen device may be more of a security problem than malware for many people anyway.
