Some Internet bad guys are exploiting heightened interest in the new Harry Potter movie to further their devious plot to take over the Web. Their target is people who can be enticed to illegally watch a copy of the new film on the Web. (So perhaps there is some kind of perverse vigilante justice at work here.) , a security company bought by Symantec last year, described the attack Thursday on their . The company says the bad guys are populating sites like Digg.com and Blogspot and sending spam e-mail messages with enticements to “‘Watch “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince online free” and links to a bogus film site. They are also flooding the comment sections of these sites with various Harry Potter related keywords, to try to trick search engines into displaying their site in search results. People who fall for it and visit the bogus film site are then treated to a barely credible Harry Potter page on Google’s Blogspot service (although PC Tools says the location of the site changes) with images from the movie. (Here’s a .) And finally, for the people who are both gullible and simply cannot wait to see the movie in the theater, clicking further on the page prompts a download of a file called “streamviewer,” and well, you can imagine what happens from there. PC Tools reports that the victim’s computer is visited by a rotating selection of choice malware, including the koobface worm. “This is headline malware,” said Mike Greene, vice president of product strategy at PC Tools. “When Michael Jackson passed away we saw a surge around that. Whenever you see a headline, you can be pretty confident you will find some hot malware.” Comments are no longer being accepted. Darwinism is dead. Social Darwinism is dead. Technological Darwinism is very much alive. How stupid can people be? Most of the “victims” of such malware probably know more about the personal lives of the celebrities involved than they know about their own PCs. I used to feel sorry for such people. I no longer do. These days, I just charge them $50/hr each time I clean the out the slime… The Potter virus is categorized as crimeware, which searches your computer for credit card or bank information, Greene said. “[The hackers] will collect credit card details, social security numbers. Then they’ll turn around and sell that to another group, a ‘carding operation’ they call it, and these guys will buy blank credit cards from a third group; they’ll put them together, print out the credit cards and then sell physical credit cards with your numbers on the street.” You can watch a lot of movies and TV shows online for free from non-official sources. The page it links to looks exactly like one of these non-official sources, so it seems a little silly to call it a “barely credible Harry Potter page”. I haven´t seen the movie yet, but I´ll wait until I can see it on the theater. For the real fans of H.P. virus on the web is not a problem; we´ll watch it properly! The author refers to “a file called streamviewer”. The fact is that streamviewer is an open source tool, for viewing certain types of files. It is NOT MALWARE! The simple way to avoid worms, and viruses is to not use a Microsoft operating system. Microsoft Windows is the culprit, for trying to monopolize the internet. My computer has been virus free, since I deleted every piece of windows garbage from my computer years ago. Linux and Mac are the way to go. Microsoft is a corporate dinosaur. I forgot to mention. LINUX is FREE and open source. If it seems to good to be true, it is. People seem to have trouble with that most basic fact. And they pay. This is nothing new – It happens with all illegal movie sites regularly. Why is this even a news? Or is it a Harry Potter publicity stunt?
