The people who design rogue programs that take over computers from afar are now applying the tactic that made music pirating programs so effective -- and the Internet may never be the same. The rogue programs, known generically as ''Trojan horses,'' have enabled pornographers and others to mask their identities by using unwitting people's computers as relay stations. It had been assumed that diligent investigators could ultimately shut down a system by identifying the server computer used as the initial launching pad. But now a researcher has determined that a new kind of Trojan horse could make the systems virtually unstoppable. Joe Stewart, a computer expert at the LURHQ Corporation, a security company based in Chicago, said that he discovered this new phase in the evolution of Trojan horse programs while taking apart a program called Backdoor.Sinit, which has been circulating on the Internet since late September. Sinit, Mr. Stewart said, does something unexpected: it uses the commandeered machines to form a peer-to-peer network like the popular Kazaa program used to trade music files. Each machine on the network can share resources and provide information to the others without being controlled by a central server machine. ''It's like Kazaa only without all the pesky copyrighted files,'' Mr. Stewart said. And, as the music industry has discovered, when there is no central machine, ''these tactics make it impossible to shut down,'' he said. Computer security researchers have been watching the evolution of remote-access rogue programs as they have become more common and have put more machines under the control of hackers. Programs like Sinit infect target machines and surreptitiously open back doors that allow outsiders to control the PC's. The rings of infected computers have been used to send spam, to present online advertisements for pornographic Web sites or to trick people into giving up information like credit card numbers. In fact, at least a third of all spam circulating on the Internet is now sent from or relayed by personal home computers that have been taken over, said Jesse Dougherty, director of development at Sophos, an antivirus and antispam company. Security researchers began to notice an enormous rise in the volume of spam in the summer, when versions of the SoBig virus were making their way across the Internet. SoBig, Mr. Dougherty said, ''was so big and so virulent that people started to wonder, 'What is the purpose of all this?''' Clues have started to emerge. Each version of SoBig was programmed with a life span, turning itself off after a month. The regular updating of the program hinted at a commercial use, Mr. Dougherty said, ''almost like a subscription'' that would expire after a time. Researchers found further evidence that Trojan programs were used in spamming, Mr. Dougherty said, when a new malicious program, MiMail, circulated and caused infected machines to attack the computers of organizations that fight spam. The problem for the hackers was that the system could still be defeated at its weakest point. Many of the early rings were programmed to download software updates and instructions from a single site that could be discovered and shut down. The creator of SoBig created a smokescreen of 20 hosts that would communicate with the commandeered machines through encrypted messages, but the network still had a single central download site. That structure allowed law enforcement agents to find and shut down the download site and the go-betweens, Mr. Stewart said. Now the Trojan program designers are taking the ''next logical step,'' Mr. Stewart said, and moving to the peer-to-peer model. The Sinit program has been discovered on machines that have been hijacked to serve pop-up advertisements and to download ''porn-dialers,'' programs that cause the victim's machine to turn on the modem and place expensive pay-per-minute phone calls. ''Sinit appears to have been created as a money-making endeavor,'' Mr. Stewart said in a research paper describing his discovery. ''This Trojan is also further evidence that money, not notoriety, is now the major driving force behind the spread of malware these days.'' There is now a market for the services of networks of infected machines, which can allow illicit operators to carry out scams and activities prohibited by legitimate Internet service providers. On Web sites frequented by hackers, spammers and people who identify themselves as practitioners of credit card fraud, the remote-access networks, or ''radmins,'' are offered openly. On one such site, Carder Planet, a typical pitch from ''r00t3d'' reads, ''I have a steady supply of FAST radmins. I am wanting to offer these to those of you who need good hosting for your scam pages'' for periods of a week to ''six months or more'' for a price of $50 per machine. The hacker did not respond to online requests for further information, but in a general discussion on the site he defended his work on Trojan-infected machines by saying ''money makes this forum and the world go around.'' He added that ''spam page hosting is obviously needed,'' and therefore, ''people will purchase that service.'' The implications for the Internet of the new breed of Trojan programs are troubling, said Bruce Schneier, the founder and chief technical officer of Counterpane Internet Security Inc. ''A self-replicating peer-to-peer network is kind of scary,'' he said, not just because a less easily detectable network is bad news, but because it offers proof that hackers, once primarily interested in breaking into systems for thrills, now have a profit motive. Hacking, he said, ''used to be kids spray-painting -- just annoying.'' In the past, the likeliest career path for a hacker was to become a security consultant for companies needing help finding computer vulnerabilities. Now, he said, malicious hacking is becoming a business, which ''brings it to the next level.''
