Teaching ideas based on New York Times content. In this lesson, students learn about the roles of adware and spyware on the Internet. They then take part in a fishbowl discussion on the rights of both consumers and corporations regarding the use of these programs.  Annissa Hambouz, The New York Times Learning Network Javaid Khan, The Bank Street College of Education in New York City 1 hour Students will: 1. Consider their knowledge of and opinions about user privacy and targeted advertising on the Internet. 2. Learn the definitions of “adware” and “spyware.” 3. Explore issues of consumer and corporate rights by taking part in a fishbowl discussion on the use of adware and spyware. 4. After reading “Barbarians at the Digital Gate,” take a stance in the adware-spyware debate by arguing the position of an adware company C.E.O. or a consumer rights advocate. -pens/pencils -paper -copies of the article “Barbarians at the Digital Gate,” found online at (one per student) -poster boards labeled “Agree” and “Disagree” 1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Before the class period, tape poster boards labeled “Agree” and “Disagree” on opposite sides of the classroom, and move desks or tables to allow students to move freely from one side to the other. Next, write the following definitions of “adware” and “spyware” from Webster University ( ) on the board and cover before students enter the room: “adware – any software application in which advertising banners are displayed while the program itself is running” “spyware – any technology that aids in gathering information about a person, organization, or computer without user knowledge or consent” When students enter the class, have them gather in the center of the room and move to either “Agree” or “Disagree” sides as you read following statements: -I hate pop-up ads on the Internet. -I often click on ads while surfing the Net. -The ads that appear on my screen are targeted toward my age group and interests. -There is no one monitoring my computer use outside of my house. -I am the only one who knows my logins and passwords. After completing the exercise, students take their seats and briefly discuss their responses to the statements. Ask how many are familiar with the terms “adware” and “spyware,” and then reveal the definitions on the board. Have students brainstorm a list of positive and negative attributes of each type of technology and note them on the board under their definitions. 2. Explain to the class that they will be participating in a “fishbowl” discussion on the rights of both consumers and corporations regarding the use of adware and spyware. First, ask students to number off one to five, and then keep a list on the board of all “1’s,” “2’s,” “3’s,” “4’s,” and “5’s.” Ask all “1’s” to sit facing one another in the middle of a circle created by the rest of the students. The students in the center are the only ones allowed to speak. If a student from the outer circle wants to add to the discussion, he or she moves to the middle of the circle, taps a participant to indicate that he or she should resume a place in the outer circle, and takes that student’s place as the new person in the discussion. After discussing the first question, switch the students in the center to all “2’s,” and allow the same fishbowl procedure to occur. Be sure to switch topics enough times so that all students have the opportunity to be in the center of the discussion at least once. Questions to pose to students include the following: -Are pop-up and other forms of Internet advertisements necessary? Why or why not? -Should a consumer have the right to block all advertisements from his or her Web browser? Why or why not? -Should adware companies have the right to target advertisements based on personal information about the user? Why or why not? -Should companies have the right to monitor what you do on your computer if they use the information they gather responsibly? Why or why not? -Should software that includes spyware be sold to the public without explicitly stating that it includes such programs? Why or why not? -Can spyware be beneficial to both the company and the consumer? If so, how? If not, why not? 3. After concluding the fishbowl discussion, each student receives a copy of the article “Barbarians at the Digital Gate” ( ) to read for homework. 4. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: At home, students read “Barbarians at the Digital Gate” and respond to one of the following two writing prompts (copied into a handout and distributed to students before leaving class): 1. You are the C.E.O. of an adware company that has received numerous complaints from consumer advocacy groups on the ubiquity of pop-ups and other types of ads your company produces. Write a press release in response to consumer concerns raised “Barbarians at the Digital Gate” that outlines the ways in which your company plans to “overhaul their practices so thoroughly that they are seen as responsible online citizens.” 2. You are the leader of a new consumer advocacy group dedicated to investigating and fighting issues of Internet user privacy. You agree with Gary A. Kibel, the lawyer quoted in “Barbarians at the Digital Gate,” that “federal legislation could help formalize and sanitize the business” of Internet adware and spyware. Write a proposal for a piece of legislation that would protect consumers and regulate the means by which corporations gather information and target consumers. -How do you think consumers can better protect themselves from having personal information such as their passwords and logins exploited by spyware? -Should Internet users have the right to sue spyware companies for invading their privacy? Why or why not? -To what lengths do you think spyware and adware companies should go to gain the trust of the consumer public? -Do you think the comparison between Internet pop-up ads and television commercials is an apt one? Why or why not? Students will be evaluated based on participation in warm-up exercise, fishbowl discussion, and thoughtfully written homework assignments.

Create a glossary for the young Internet user or consumer. Include new technology terms such as “pop-ups,” “block,” “blog,” “spam,” “malware,” and “worms.” 2. The article read in class mentions the proliferation of anti-spyware software products, many of which are downloadable from the Web. With the assistance of a few friends, download, compare and rank several of these programs for user-friendliness and effectiveness. Submit your findings to a local consumer guide or newspaper. 3. Could advertising on the Internet be more inventive and less annoying? Hold a contest in your computer programming or art and design class to re-design the way Web ads appear on the computer screen to be less obtrusive and offensive to the consumer. 4. The article read in class notes that several companies, including The New York Times, have sued the Claria adware company for violating trademark protections. What are the legal guidelines and protocol for how adware can be used on companies’ Web sites?
