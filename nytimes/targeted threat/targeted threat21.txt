Target Stores across the nation pulled a box set of children's Valentines Day cards from their shelves after a parent in Pittsburgh thought it contained a terrorist-related message. The card, based on a series of ''I Spy'' books published by Scholastic Inc. in New York City, contained the word ''Jihad,'' which can mean holy war. A spokeswoman for Scholastic said the word was actually a child's name. A Target spokesman said the company did not believe the card was appropriate for its customers and called on its 11,048 stores to remove the item. Jo Napolitano (NYT)
