> Small world indeed--look what somebody posted on the Pogue feedback boards,concerning my e-mail column last week: "So, I am out surfing today and I see a guy that I know has a timesharecompany here in the US Virgin Islands. I tell him a bit of this story and hesays, 'You mean David Pogue wrote a story about this?' Small world! Well, hestated it sounded like a good deal to him and he did not know of the issueswith it." "This is probably the case with the slew of people that have signed up forthis ad product. IMHO, a majority of the people advertising on the web haveno clue as to the background process. they are too busy running theirbusiness." To which I add, a double yes. First, I hoped to make it clear that mytimeshare-company buddy may or may not have known what he was getting intowhen he signed up for the spyware service. Second, it's entirely possiblethat he, and others, don't know how these marketing programs work. By the way, my Virgin Islands friend also contacted me, considerably rattledby my little story. It's become clearer to me that he didn't know that he'dsigned up for a spyware service. I'm hopeful that perhaps he'll reconsider.
