To the Editor: Re ''Zipping Up Big Files So They'll Travel Light,'' (Q & A, March 15): Some months ago, while attempting to identify seemingly spontaneous Internet activity from my PC, I discovered that a free trial version of PKZIP had installed advertising software, known as spyware, along with PKZIP. I went to the PKWare site and was pleasantly surprised to see a notice at its demo downloading area specifically stating that the trial versions offered did not contain the dreaded spy program. Readers should be cautioned that many of the free demo versions of PKZIP found elsewhere on the Web do contain spyware. JOSEPH GELLER New York
