> So get this: now Microsoft is readying a for-fee subscription service that "provide automatically updated anti-virus, anti-spyware and two-way firewall protection." The service will automatically carry out "disk cleanup, hard-drive defragmentation and file repair," plus "automated backup of files by category on CD and DVD." It actually sounds pretty cool--if it really made my Windows XP machine headache-free, I'd probably sign up--but there's one niggling doubt. Something inside me wants to say: "Hey, if you guys built Windows XP the right way to begin with, I wouldn't need some added-cost program to keep it running!"Not to mention the small anti-competitive aspect. How'd you like to be one of the antivirus or backup companies right about now?
