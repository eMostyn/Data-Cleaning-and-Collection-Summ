FROM THE DESK OF DAVID POGUE > Last week, the Pogue family spent the kids winter school break in the U.S. Virgin Islands. I mention that not to boast about our exotic vacation spot, but to set the scene for todays little story: namely, an island where Internet access is hard to find. And in my case, Internet access was critical, because I had both a Times column and a couple of multimegabyte book chapters to turn in during my time away. (Insert workaholic-on-the-beach joke here.) After a little asking around, I unearthed two possibilities. First, a local Internet café sold online access for $2 a minute. Over a dial-up connection. Using their computers, not your own laptop. (The reason: The shop owner explained that he worries about his computers getting a virus from customers laptops, as though a virus were some kind of airborne bug that a PC can catch just by being in the same room. Whatever.) The other possibility: Through a friend, I was invited to use the private, high-speed, wireless Internet connection of a timeshare and vacation-package sales company (at its offices). So the guy turned out to be really nice; he offered me a drink and a comfy chair. Before long, I was uploading away and chatting with him. Grateful for the free connection, I made every attempt to be an attentive and cheerful listener. He was exclaiming about how much better his business was doing since he started advertising on the Internet. Whats really great is that Ive signed up for a search-keyword program, he said. If you type in vacation packages on Yahoo, you get our ad at the top of the browser. Full color, animation, everything! And its only $500 a year. I congratulated him on his marketing savvy, but I didnt quite follow that bit about color ads on Yahoo. Last I checked, Yahoos ads were brief, all-text affairs. So I tried it on my PowerBook. Sure enough, no ad. Oh, you have to have Internet Explorer for Windows, he said. And you have to have a special plug-in. He demonstrated on HIS laptop, and sure enough: a big color ad at the top of the Yahoo results window. But now I was confused again. But who would voluntarily install your plug-in, just to see bigger ads? I mean, they must get some cool feature in return, right? I dont know, he said. But the guy who runs this program says that 16 million people have it. And its only $500 a year, so I figured, what the heck. Now he pulled up the Web site of the $500-a-year guy, which Ill call BigSearchAds.com. I scanned the home-page text. Advertise your products and services under the most popular keywords, blah blah blahand then I saw the line that made my blood freeze. We are propagating through freeware titles available on Downloads.com. Our network userbase has grown to over 16 million desktops! I could have smacked myself. How stupid could I have been? Of COURSE nobody would willingly download a special plug-in to display bigger adsthey didnt even know they had it. It was spyware! This $500-a-year guy was selling ads through spyware! How many times have I written about spywarebut always in an us-versus-them voice, where THEY are the snakes of the Internet? Now here was one of them, sitting next to meand, worse, doing me a huge favor by letting me use his connection. I was literally speechless for about ten seconds. What should I do? Conduct an on-the-spot citizens arrest? I wondered if it were possible he didnt even know what hed signed up for. Um, just so you know, youve signed up for something called spyware, and an awful lot of your customers might really wind up angry, I began. He seemed suddenly nervous, but I couldnt tell if it was because I was confronting him, or because he hadnt known, and he was worried that he was doing something shady. I mean, heyits your business, I went on, not wanting to seem overly judgmental. Has it been producing great results for you? I dont know yet, the guy said. I just signed up. I nodded. Well, if you wanted to do the same kind of thing in a less controversial way, you might consider just signing up for a more traditional search-results ad program, like Googles AdWords, I suggested. For the remainder of our chat, I was intensely uncomfortable. Using the wireless network of someone who was contributing to the spyware problem somehow seemed like getting a ride in a drug dealers limo. At the end, though, the guy did ask how much Google AdWords costs and a couple other questions. I hoped that that meant he might consider a less scurrilous marketing approach. Later that day, I learned that I could get online from my own hotel room via a local MSN access number; with relief, I signed up for an account via MSNs 800 number. Dialing up never felt so good.
