Handheld Computer Virus Found August 29, 2000 &nbsp; Handheld Computer Virus Found By AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE ASHINGTON, Aug 29 -- The first virus attacking hand-held personal digital assistants using the Palm operating system has been detected on the Internet, software companies reported. Experts called the new bug, reports of which surfaced Monday, a "Trojan horse" virus that deletes applications on the Palm operating system, but poses little threat to computer users. Software firms said the bug was inserted in pirated software purported to emulate a Nintendo Gameboy on Palm PDAs. US-based Network Associates said that although the virus was not especially harmful, it could signal a new trend toward attacks on wireless devices. "This is the beginning of yet another phase in the war against hackers and virus writers," said Gene Hodges, president of McAfee, a division of Network Associates, "In fact, the real significance of this latest Trojan discovery is the proof of concept that it represents. Fortunately and unfortunately, we've seen this evolution coming and have invested in the technology to address it and continue to do so." London-based software firm Sophos said a Swedish lecturer, Aaron Ardiri, has admitted writing the Trojan horse and giving it to "a few friends." Sophos said it was unlikely the virus would become widespread. "It has always been possible to write malicious software for the Palm operating system," said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for Sophos. "This Trojan horse is a very low threat to Palm users who are sensible enough to avoid (pirate software) mailing lists and do not download pirated software." Japan-based Trend Micro said it had received no reports of infection. &nbsp; Home | Site Index | Site Search | Forums | Archives | Marketplace Quick News | Page One Plus | International | National/N.Y. | Business | Technology | Science | Sports | Weather | Editorial | Op-Ed | Arts | Automobiles | Books | Diversions | Job Market | Real Estate | Travel Help/Feedback | Classifieds | Services | New York Today Copyright 2000 The New York Times Company
