The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) had to shut down parts of its factories. It said the attack had featured a "mutation" of the Wannacry ransomware. The manufacturing giant denied that it had been hacked and blamed an error during the installation of a new tool that had not been taken offline first. Chief executive CC Wei told reporters he was "shocked and surprised" that the attack had taken place.

"The issues suffered by TSMC remind us that any organisation, even those working at the forefront of technology development, can fall victim to malware," said Thomas Nuth, director of product at cyber-security company Nozomi Networks.
