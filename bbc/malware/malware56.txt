Lincolnshire County Council's computer systems have been closed for four days after being hit by computer malware demanding a Â£1m ransom. Ransomware encrypts data on infected machines and unscrambles it only if victims pay a fee. The council said it was working with its computer security provider to apply a fix to its systems.
