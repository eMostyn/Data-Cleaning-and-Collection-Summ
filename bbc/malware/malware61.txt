User reports of unauthorised payments being made via iTunes accounts and of apps being installed unexpectedly alerted Palo Alto to a potential problem. It found that an attacker had made changes to software used on jailbroken iPhones. A jailbroken iPhone is one that can run apps that are not sourced from the main Apple app store. The main purpose of the booby-trapped software was to let people get apps and other Apple content without paying for them. The malicious version of the code, dubbed KeyRaider by Palo Alto, spied on transactions to scoop up login names, passwords and other credentials. The stolen data was sent to a remote server run by the malicious hackers behind KeyRaider. Apple's phones are the third most popular in China behind Huawei and Xiaomi, .
