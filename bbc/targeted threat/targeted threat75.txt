DIAL Doncaster, which has been running for nearly 30 years, provides services for disabled people. A high-dependency mobile changing unit and an adapted people carrier, both recently bought, were stolen. The charity said the thefts felt worse because of funding cuts. The mobile unit has since been recovered, but was "totally vandalised". Pamela Arran, chief executive of DIAL, said both vehicles were to be launched as new services for hire, to help the charity in dealing with the cuts. "It is appalling that thieves have targeted facilities that disabled people would use," she said. "We're devastated to learn that the thieves have totally vandalised it, the cost of repairs will hit DIAL hard." It comes after all over-50s and those in high-risk groups in the UK have been offered a first dose. Greta Thunberg is on a mission to save the planet..
