It comes after the founder of Clap for Carers distanced herself from its return after facing online abuse. Annemarie Plas wanted to bring back the weekly applause under a new name of Clap for Heroes to lift spirits in the new lockdown but it fell a little flat. Some health workers have said they would rather people stay at home and wear a mask than clap for them. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he participated at 20:00 GMT on Thursday, but clapping "isn't enough". "They need to be paid properly and given the respect they deserve," he , of the health workers. The idea of clapping and banging pots from doorsteps originally began as a one-off to support NHS staff on 26 March - three days after the UK went into lockdown for the first time. After proving popular it was expanded to cover all key workers and continued every Thursday for 10 weeks last year, with millions of people across the UK taking part. Members of the Royal Family and politicians including Prime Minister Boris Johnson also joined in with the show of support. However, the event faced criticism for becoming politicised, with some suggesting the NHS would benefit more from extra funding than applause. Thursday's newly-revived event drew fewer supporters than previously. People in some streets stood on doorsteps and leaned out windows to clap for the pandemic's heroes, and landmarks in London were illuminated blue for the occasion - but reports suggested the applause was noticeably quieter than last year. On Wednesday, Ms Plas, a 36-year-old mother-of-one, announced the return of the initiative, saying she hoped to "lift the spirit of all of us" including "all who are pushing through this difficult time". But some NHS workers were less than enthusiastic. Ami Jones, an intensive care consultant from Wales, "No thanks. I'd rather you obey the rules, stay at home, wear masks and wash your hands." Please don‚Äôt clap us. Just wear a mask, wash your hands and respect lockdown üôè And palliative care doctor Rachel Clarke said: "Please don't clap us. Just wear a mask, wash your hands and respect lockdown." In posted hours before the weekly clap was due to return, Ms Plas, a Dutch national living in south London, said she had been targeted with personal abuse and threats against her and her family by "a hateful few" on social media. "I have no political agenda, I am not employed by the government, I do not work in PR, I am just an average mum at home trying to cope with the lockdown situation," she said, in a statement. She said the newly revived clap could and should still happen at 20:00 GMT. "It's up to each person to decide how relevant or worthwhile they feel it is to participate," she said.
