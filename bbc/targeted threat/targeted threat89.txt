The fire service joined forces with the county council, Forestry Commission and the National Park Authority to form the Cumbria Wildfire Group last year. During the summer, the peak time for countryside blazes, it is highlighting the training and advice it offers. Landowners, land managers and mountain rescue teams are being targeted to combat the increased threat. E SF Ethan Bigelow, the group's project officer, described its work as vital. He said: "Through educating and informing our members we are reducing the risk of blazes breaking out and teaching people about tackling them as quickly and effectively as possible if they do occur." In May, Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service took delivery of a fleet of eight specially modified Land Rovers, to assist in the battle against wildfires. E BO      Print Sponsor     | ";
