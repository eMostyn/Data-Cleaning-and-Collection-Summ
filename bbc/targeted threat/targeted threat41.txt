"Strathclyde Police is mounting a massive offensive to counter the threat of hooliganism." A dedicated intelligence operation has been set up to deal with potential trouble on Saturday. Chief Superintendent John Malcolm, who will be in command on the day of the match, said the force had been working closely with several Scottish forces, the National Criminal Intelligence Service and German police.  S IBOX   E IBOX  "A number of officers from Germany will be coming over to Glasgow for the match and they will be alerting us to potential troublemakers," he said. "We are taking this threat extremely seriously, and anyone caught causing trouble will be dealt with severely." He said genuine Scottish fans had an excellent reputation and were known across the world for their good behaviour. "This small minority of people intent on causing disruption are not real fans," said Chief Superintendent Malcolm. "They have complete disregard for the thousands of supporters who want to enjoy the game and cheer on their team. "We know who these troublemakers are and I can only stress that if they do come to Glasgow, police will be watching their every move." E BO
