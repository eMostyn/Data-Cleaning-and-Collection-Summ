The man walked into the Co-operative Bank in Peterborough just before 13:00 GMT on Saturday and handed a note to a cashier saying he had a bomb. The man, who was carrying a small rucksack with a drawstring over his shoulder, told the woman to hurry. He was handed several thousand pounds, before walking out of the building. Det Sgt Rob Norman, from Cambridgeshire Police, said: "This man walked into the bank and handed the note to the member of staff, only speaking to ask her to hurry up, before calmly walking out with the money. "We know there were some other members of the public in the bank at the time who may not have been aware a robbery was taking place but may have seen the man responsible. "I would urge them, or anyone who was in the area at the time, to consider if they saw someone matching this description. "If so, they should contact police as soon as possible. Any information could be very important to this inquiry." It is thought the man walked briefly towards the nearby Beales department store before walking back towards the Park Road area. He is described as white, 5ft 8in to 5ft 9in tall, wearing a black woollen hat with a white stripe around it, a green combat-type jacket with the collar up and blue denim jeans. Officers are now carrying out forensic tests on the note handed to the cashier. It comes after all over-50s and those in high-risk groups in the UK have been offered a first dose.
