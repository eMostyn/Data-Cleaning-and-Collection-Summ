The North Belfast Sinn Fein assembly member said his constituency office received a threat on Wednesday. He said a caller claimed a bomb would go off within the hour of the call outside the house, but after police checks nothing was found. Police have said they are investigating the call. Mr Kelly, who is in the United States, condemned the threat. E SF "As a public representative I have received threats before and this latest one will in no way detract me from carrying out my work on behalf of the people who elect me," he said. "Be assured that we will not be intimidated. "It shows the calibre of the people responsible that they would threaten my family and neighbours in such a way." E BO      Print Sponsor     | ";
