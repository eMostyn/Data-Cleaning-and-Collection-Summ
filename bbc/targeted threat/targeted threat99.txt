Carl Hodgkinson, 18, from Mansfield Road in the city, pleaded guilty at Nottingham Crown Court to nine counts of robbery. He also asked for a further 10 offences to be taken into consideration. The court heard that in May, Hodgkinson carried out robberies in and around the canal area and stole items including a laptop computer and mobile phones. E SF Police said Hodgkinson would typically ask his victims for the time, before threatening them with violence or a knife and demanding personal items and cash. Acting Det Sgt James Bond said: "Hodgkinson is a prolific robber, who often targeted vulnerable people and used the threat of violence and knives to instil fear into his victims. "This kind of offence is completely unacceptable and the police will seek to take positive action against anyone who commits such an offence." E BO      Print Sponsor     | ";
