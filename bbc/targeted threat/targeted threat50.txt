Three unpatched bugs in Word have been uncovered in the last few weeks and two are already being exploited by attackers. The loopholes being exploited allow attackers to create booby-trapped documents that steal information or take over a PC when they are opened. Microsoft has yet to release patches to fix the bugs in the Word software. E SF    Information about the latest problem in Word was posted only a couple of days after Microsoft released its latest security update. Over the last year malicious hackers have taken to releasing code soon after the regularly-scheduled monthly Microsoft security update to give them the biggest chance to abuse it before a patch appears. So far the latest Word exploit, which revolves around the way the information describing formatting is handled, is only a proof-of-concept flaw but Symantec and McAfee have confirmed that it will work. Abusing the flaw could allow attackers to take over a PC or run malicious code on a compromised machine. The latest flaw joins two others that Microsoft has acknowledged are already being exploited in attacks which it describes as "limited and targeted". To avoid falling victim it said: "users should always exercise extreme caution when opening unsolicited attachments from both known and unknown sources". Malicious Word documents exploiting one bug discovered in early December are known to have been spammed out to firms in Asia. Together the three vulnerabilities are found in Microsoft Word 2000, 2002, Office 2003, Word Viewer 2003, Word 2004 for Mac, and Word v. X for Mac and Works 2004, 2005, and 2006. Microsoft pointed out that to fall victim to the attacks users must receive and then open a booby-trapped Word document. On its security blog Microsoft said it was actively investigating the three problems and would release patches when work was complete. E BO  | ";
