Ashley Hutton believes Northern Ireland "have more to give" ahead of Tuesday's Euro 2022 play-off second leg against Ukraine at Seaview. Ulster will face Leicester away in the European Challenge Cup semi-finals on the weekend of 30 April/2 May with Bath drawn against Montpellier. The Irish Cup final and both semi-finals will be played at Mourneview Park, with all three games being shown live on BBC Two NI.
