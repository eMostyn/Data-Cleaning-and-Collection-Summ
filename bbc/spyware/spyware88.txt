Germany's justice minister has called for a national and state level probe into the use of controversial computer software to spy on people. The German state of Bavaria has admitted using the spyware, but claimed it had acted within the law. Three other states have also confirmed they have used spyware in order to investigate serious criminal offences, a German newspaper reports. Use of the software was exposed by a German hacker group.
