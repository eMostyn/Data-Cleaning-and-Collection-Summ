An internet watchdog based in Canada, Citizen Lab, said the surveillance software is only sold to governments. Last week, Citizen Lab also said that 12 journalists and human rights lawyers had been targeted. At the time, the Mexican President, Enrique Peña Nieto, described accusations that the government was involved as false. Mr Peña Nieto said surveillance software was only used for matters of national security and for fighting organised crime. He added that he had ordered an investigation by the attorney general's office. Citizen Lab said the head of the Conservative National Action Party (PAN), Ricardo Anaya, a PAN Senator, Roberto Gil Zuarth, and the party's communications secretary, Fernando Rodriguez, were targeted. "There is strong circumstantial evidence implicating the government of Mexico", the watchdog said.
