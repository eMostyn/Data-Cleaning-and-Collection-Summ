The father of Lilian Lepere, the man who reportedly hid from the two Charlie Hebdo shooting suspects during a siege in Dammartin-en-Goele in France, has told reporters that he and the family were "doing well". According to media reports, Lepere, an employee of the print works business, took cover from the Cherif and Said Kouachi, who had barricaded themselves in. The brothers were both killed when French police stormed the premises.
