Jeremy Corbyn, the man leading the race to become the next leader of the Labour Party, has responded to criticism of his campaign. Leadership rival Yvette Cooper said Mr Corbyn's economic policies were 'not credible' and compared support for him to support for the SNP and UKIP. Meanwhile, former prime minister Tony Blair said the party risked "annihilation" if Mr Corbyn won the leadership contest. Speaking during a visit to supporters in Aberdeen, Mr Corbyn said he just wanted to "talk about the issues".
