targeted threat62.txt

So many posters in Reading East have been damaged in recent weeks that there is speculation that the vandalism is part of an organised campaign. 

Thames Valley Police told the BBC News website that they were investigating the attacks after several complaints.

Representatives from Labour, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say they have all been targeted.




John Howson, Liberal Democrat candidate, said many of their posters had been vandalised, especially those on Henley Road.

He said that a certain amount of damage to posters was to be expected during an election but this was not the "usual, mindless" type which tends to happen on a Friday or Saturday night.

Tony Page, the Labour candidate, said: "Some of our posters have been subjected to vandalism, and I have condemned the attacks on all political posters."

He said the damage was annoying but "there are more important things going on in this election".

Rob Wilson, the Conservative candidate, said the vandalism of the posters posed  "a threat to democracy".

He said that anti-social behaviour and graffiti were problems "people across Reading East have been fighting against".
