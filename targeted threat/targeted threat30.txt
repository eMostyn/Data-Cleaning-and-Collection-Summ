Pietersen scored two sparkling fifties on his debut in the first Test and was the star performer in England's 239-run defeat at Lord's.

"We've got to have a bit of a look at the way Kevin played in the first Test," said Ponting.

Pietersen was the only home batsman to come out of the first Ashes Test with any credit as he became only the third England player to score two half-centuries on his Lord's debut.

He impressed many with the way he took on the attack of Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath and looked totally at ease in the Test arena. 

And Ponting suggested Australia may try to be more aggressive with the 25-year-old when the second match starts at Edgbaston on Thursday. 

Ponting said: "We had some plans going into the game that we executed well for a short period of time, but we've got to be able to do it well for long periods of time against him.

"When he first comes to the crease is one area we've got to have a look at and see what we can come up with for him. 

"He was fairly conservative in the first Test and got himself in before taking the bowlers on.

"We've got to think about whether we are happy with starving him of runs early on or should we have a real aggressive go at him early on, make him play a few shots and see if we can get a mistake out of him.

"Those are the sort of things we've got to weigh up in the next couple of days when we hold our team meetings."
