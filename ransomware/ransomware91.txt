I came back from house visits to find all our computers hit by the virus."It was the red display asking for the money.  We can't access any patient records. "Everything is fully computerised. We have no idea what drugs people are on or the allergies they have. We can't access the appointments system."We've had to try and phone as many people to rearrange their appointments to next week."It's had a massively disruptive effect. We can't process any documents, can't issue prescriptions, or look up results."We're trying to accommodate who we can. We are still seeing people who really need it."We've had glitches in the past but I've never seen anything as bad as this.

There is no impact on NHS Tayside's emergency departments or out-of-hours service."However, we are aware that the IT systems at 10 GP practices across Tayside, which operate on a non-NHS Tayside system, have been affected. Our eHealth team is working with the GPs to resolve the issue as soon as possible."

"The practices affected remain open and have put in place contingency arrangements."An NHS Western Isles spokeswoman said: "We can confirm that we have been affected but can't confirm to what extent at the moment."We do have systems in place to cover all emergencies."Meanwhile, ScottishPower said that it had taken measures to ensure its IT services were not affected.A spokesman said: "Due to an issue at an external company, ScottishPower has taken precautionary steps to ensure that our IT systems are fully secure.
