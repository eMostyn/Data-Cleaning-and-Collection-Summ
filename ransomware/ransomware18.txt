"Our automated security systems disabled the accounts due to the bulk creation of multiple consumer Gmail accounts from the same network," The cyber-attack has meant that many day-to-day administration tasks of Baltimore's city government have stopped. It has delayed the sales of many homes, and stopped water bills being generated. And people cannot pay tax bills or parking fines.

About 10,000 computers were hit by the virus.Baltimore has so far refused to pay the ransom. The FBI and Secret Service are known to be investigating.City Mayor Bernard Young said it was unclear when systems would be back in full operation.Last year Baltimore was hit by a cyber-attack which knocked out the communications systems for emergency services for a day.
