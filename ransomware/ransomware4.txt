Owners of its products had been unable to use its services since Thursday.However, some of its online tools are now being provided in a "limited" state, .Garmin has said it was "the victim of a cyber-attack that encrypted some of our systems".But the statement it released avoided any reference to a ransom demand."Many of our online services were interrupted including website functions, customer support, customer-facing applications, and company communications," it said."We have no indication that any customer data, including payment information from Garmin Pay, was accessed, lost or stolen."The firm added that it expected all its systems to return to normal operation within a few days, but warned that there might be a "backlog" of user data to process.It is not known if the firm paid the blackmailers, but a source told the BBC it was in the "final stage of recovery".The BBC's cyber reporter Joe Tidy said the malware involved was Wasted Locker - a program that scrambles the target's data, and was first detected in the wild around April.
