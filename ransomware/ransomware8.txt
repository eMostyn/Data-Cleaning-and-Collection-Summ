Council leader Mary Lanigan said "systems are being rebuilt" and they had "a massive team here - including cyber-security experts - working around the clock flat out to get it fixed".The council said: "We are still able to receive and answer limited calls and emails and we will be prioritising urgent messages."There may be a slight delay in dealing with non-urgent calls and messages as the council's website is currently down."Our teams are working hard to resolve the problem and we would like to thank residents for their continued patience at this time."Security researcher Kevin Beaumont said: "It seems almost certain they have suffered a severe ransomware incident."The serious nature of the attack and the impact it has had should raise eyebrows with UK authorities about the need to put more resources into tackling cyber-crime groups."Batch of home testing kits identified and each household being contacted, Matt Hancock tells MPs.Check out what's already available on BBC iPlayerCheck out kitchen-disco queen Sophie Ellis-Bextor's helpful tipsÂ© 2021 BBC.
