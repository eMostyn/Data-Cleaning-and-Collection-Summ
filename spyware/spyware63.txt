The app which is owned by Facebook, said the hack targeted a "select number of users".The attack was first discovered earlier this month.The hackers were able to install the surveillance software by ringing the device.A report by the newspaper the Financial Times found that even if the call was not picked up the surveillance software could be installed.The Financial Times said, the spyware was developed by NSO Group, an Israeli cybersecurity and intelligence company.
