"This makes it possible to retrieve personal data, intercept calls and online banking data, read emails and text messages or control the camera and microphone remotely."The program also blocks the installation of security updates."The Associated Press news agency has reported that although several Shenzhen-based firms used eBay and other sites to sell the model, it had been unable to track down the manufacturer.If the allegations are true, it is not known whether the manufacturer itself would have been aware of what was being done at its plant.
