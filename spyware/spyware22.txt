Tracking and listening devices, often disguised as everyday objects, retail online for under £50 and are easy to install, says the .There are no official figures but "digital abuse" is often experienced by victims of domestic violence, it adds.People with abusive partners should also be wary of gadgets given to their children, the charity warns."Eighteen months ago I issued advice to domestic violence groups about fathers gifting smartphones or even allowing them to take them on access visits because it is so easy for abusers to use them as surveillance," said Jennifer Perry, chief executive of the newly formed Digital-Trust."I recommend children are given inexpensive pay as you go phones when visiting an abusive parent."Ms Perry said incidents of digital abuse - ranging from surveillance to accessing voicemails, emails and cloud accounts, is escalating in the UK.In addition cheap surveillance devices - small GPS trackers, listening devices and cameras hidden inside books, lamps, plug sockets and carbon monoxide detectors, are freely available online despite some of them being illegal."If I have a domestic violence victim I assume there will be some type of digital abuse - it's not the exception, it's the assumption," she told the BBC.Ms Perry added that in her experience it is more likely to happen to female victims."I get a lot of criticism for saying it but I don't see this level or type of surveillance used against male victims," she added."I see men using it against women.

Another looked at someone's Facebook page 2,500 times in one month."Batch of home testing kits identified and each household being contacted, Matt Hancock tells MPs.Check out what's already available on BBC iPlayerCheck out kitchen-disco queen Sophie Ellis-Bextor's helpful tips© 2021 BBC.
