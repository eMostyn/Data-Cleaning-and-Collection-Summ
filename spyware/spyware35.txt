Residents of Bnei Brak, just outside Tel Aviv, will only be allowed out in exceptional circumstances. Only some key workers will be allowed in.A senior health official said almost 40% of the town probably had the virus, though his claim was refuted.Overall, more than 7,000 Israelis have been infected and 37 have died.Across the country, people have been told to stay within a 100-metre (330 ft) radius of their homes; public gatherings have been banned; and anyone going outdoors has been told to cover their face with a mask or scarf.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is in voluntary self-isolation despite testing negative for the disease, has warned that further restrictions might be imposed to try to curb the spread of the virus.Bnei Brak was declared a "restricted zone" at a cabinet meeting on Thursday night.

Their access to the internet and social media is also limited for religious reasons, meaning news and information from the outside world is comparatively poor.In some strictly religious communities, gatherings for prayer and celebrations including weddings have continued to take place, despite the nationwide ban.
